        <h2>Early Development</h2>
        <p><strong>1991:</strong> The Java project, initially called "Oak," was started by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton at Sun Microsystems. The project aimed to create a programming language for consumer electronics and embedded devices.</p>
        <p><strong>1992:</strong> The team developed the first version of the language and started work on a technology called the "Green Project." It was intended to run on various devices, including televisions and toasters.</p>
        <p><strong>1995:</strong> The language was renamed to "Java." Sun Microsystems officially announced Java and released the first public version (Java 1.0). Java's key features included its write-once, run-anywhere capability due to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and its platform-independent nature.</p>
    
        <h2>Growth and Expansion</h2>
        <p><strong>1996:</strong> Java was introduced as part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.0. It quickly gained traction for its portability and ease of use in building web applications. The launch of Java applets allowed for the creation of interactive content on web pages.</p>
        <p><strong>1998:</strong> Java 2 was released, introducing significant improvements, including the Swing GUI toolkit, Collections framework, and enhancements to the JVM. Java 2 was divided into three editions:
            <ul>
                <li>J2SE (Java 2 Standard Edition)</li>
                <li>J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition)</li>
                <li>J2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>2004:</strong> Java 5 (also known as J2SE 5.0) was released, introducing major language enhancements such as generics, metadata annotations, enumerated types, and the enhanced for loop.</p>
    
        <h2>Modernization</h2>
        <p><strong>2006:</strong> Sun Microsystems released Java SE 6, also known as Java 6. This version included improvements to performance, new scripting capabilities with support for the Java Compiler API, and updates to the Java Virtual Machine.</p>
        <p><strong>2009:</strong> Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems. Java continued to evolve under Oracle's stewardship, with the release of Java SE 7 (also known as Java 7) that included features like the diamond operator and try-with-resources statement.</p>
        <p><strong>2014:</strong> Java SE 8 was released, introducing major new features like lambdas, the Stream API, and the java.time package for date and time. This version marked a significant update, bringing functional programming features into Java.</p>
    
        <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
        <p><strong>2017:</strong> Java 9 introduced the module system, which helped in managing dependencies and improving the modularity of Java applications.</p>
        <p><strong>2018:</strong> Java 10 was released, followed by Java 11 in 2018, which became a Long-Term Support (LTS) version. Java 11 included several new features and API updates, and it marked the beginning of a new release cadence with a new version every six months.</p>
        <p><strong>2020:</strong> Java 14, Java 15, and Java 16 continued the biannual release cycle, bringing features like Record Types, Pattern Matching for instanceof, and Sealed Classes.</p>
        <p><strong>2021:</strong> Java 17, the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version, was released with features such as sealed classes, pattern matching for switch, and enhanced random number generation.</p>
    
        <h2>Current State</h2>
        <p>Java remains a cornerstone in the development of enterprise applications, Android apps, and large-scale systems. It continues to evolve, with the Java community actively contributing to its development and the Java platform adapting to modern computing needs.</p>
        <p>Java's enduring popularity is attributed to its robust performance, extensive libraries, and a strong developer community.</p></div></div>
